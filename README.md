# Shooter-Game

Before I knew I wanted to be a web developer, I completed the Python bootcamp on Udemy and created this shooter game using pygame!

It is a great introduction to basic Python skills, such as defining fnctions and if-statements.

This was a tutorial done by the brilliant Tim of the Tech with Tim Yoututbe Channel (link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY&t=734s).

In my opinion, Tim's channel is the single best resource to use for all of my coding needs. He has over a million subscribers ebcause of his clear, in-depth 
tutorials and projects on just about every coding topic that comes to mind. Whatever programming route that you go down, Tim is a master teacher that will help
get you there in the most eficicent way possible. Just had to give him a shoutout as his channel has been immensely helpful along my front end development journey.


I completeled this project to demonstrate my basic skills in python, and I plan to use Tech with Tim to learn more about python and python frameworks 
like django or Flask and upload further projects once I solidify a role as a front end developer.

Enjoy!
